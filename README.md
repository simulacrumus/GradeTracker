APPLICATION NAME: GradeTracker
VERSION: 1.0


This application is designed with the sole intention of improving the lives of students everywhere, regardless of their program of choice. 
Throughout the semester courses tend to move at a very fast paced, making it far too easy for students to become disorganized. Forgetting an
assignment's due date, not knowing the value of a assignment, and not knowing one's current grade in a course are just some
of the problems that this application provides solutions for.

Utilizing Object Oriented Programming methodologies (Encapsulation, Polymorphism, Inheritance) combined with the knowledge attained 
from discussions held with numerous students in various programs, this application provides an all in one solution to the common problems 
that impact all students. Start by setting a goal grade to keep track of how close or how far you are from achieving your goal grade for 
the course throughout the semester. Track coursework, grades received, and due dates. View your progress throughout the semester 
at any given time by visiting your dashboard, in here you'll be able to compare your grades in one course with your grades in another. 
View your current grade and projected grade in a course by visiting the course directly.  

Thank you for taking the time to use GradeTracker, we hope you find it as useful as we have!
